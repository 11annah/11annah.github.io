# 11annah.github.io

Okay, so the goal of this repository is the following: 
1. set up a personal website using the [reverie template](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie/tree/master)
2. host a sub-website under teaching/lmustatistics-MV-SoSe24/ using the [jekyll course website template](https://github.com/kazemnejad/jekyll-course-website-template)

For problems to be solved, see the 'Issues' section.
Currently, I am struggling with the blog (Updates) section of the personal website.
