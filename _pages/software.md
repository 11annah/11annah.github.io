I am currently developing an R-package, `CompInt`.
Its goal of is to (eventually) allow users to compute all quantities in the paper from my first PhD project, ["A formal framework for generalized reporting methods in parametric settings"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02621), for a variety of model objects.

At the moment, this package is still in mid-development; but you can install the development version from the [`CompInt` GitHub repository](https://github.com/11annah/CompInt/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#compint).
