### This semester: Multivariate Statistics
After working as a TA since I was an undergraduate student, I am super enthusiastic about getting to design and teach [my debut course, Multivariate Statistics, at LMU Munich](https://11annah-s-teachings.github.io)!

### Bachelor's and Master's theses
Coming soon.
