### This semester: Multivariate Statistics
After working as a TA since I was an undergraduate student, I am super enthusiastic about getting to design and teach [my debut course, Multivariate Statistics, at LMU Munich](https://11annah-s-teachings.github.io)!

### Bachelor's and Master's theses
If you are a Bachelor or Master student at the Department of 
Statistics at the LMU Munich and are interested to write your thesis on a topic related to my research, 
I would be happy to meet you together with the potential co-supervisors
[Sabine Hoffmann](https://www.statistik.uni-muenchen.de/personen/mitarbeitende/hoffmann/index.html) or [Anne-Laure Boulesteix](https://www.ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de/mitarbeiter/professoren/boulesteix/index.html).
