Hi there👋

I'm Hannah, a second year <a href="https://zuseschoolrelai.de">relAI</a> PhD student in Statistics at LMU Munich and also affiliated with the <a href="https://mcml.ai">Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)</a>.

<!--and also affiliated with the Munich <a href="https://mcml.ai">Center for Machine Learning (MCML)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de/lehrstuehle/ls-mansmann/mitarbeiter/kuempel_hannah/index.html">The Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology (IBE)</a>, which is fitting because I am super interested in both Machine Learning (ML) (some people would say AI, but I do not like that term) and Biostatistics...
To be more specific, my research interests could be adequately summarized as Bayesian Inference, interpretable ML, meta-analysis & reporting methods, and open science.-->

Originally, this website was purely intended to promote my career as a researcher and lecturer, but then I realized that it might be a good idea to write some blog posts instead of constantly bothering my co-workers with my strong opinions about everything from why I do not like the term "AI" to why Frequentists are wrong😄 - you can find my posts under [Updates]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/index.html).

Lastly, here are some fun facts about me:
* I have dual German-Canadian citizenship🇨🇦
* I don't really enjoy beer, even though I live in Bavaria 🍺❌
* I got married last year💍
* I am definetely a Bayes-fan!🤓
