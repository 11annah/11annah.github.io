Hi there👋

I'm Hannah, a second year PhD student in Statistics at LMU Munich, and also affiliated with the Munich <a href="https://mcml.ai">Center for Machine Learning (MCML)</a>, and <a href="https://www.ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de/lehrstuehle/ls-mansmann/mitarbeiter/kuempel_hannah/index.html">The Institute for Medical Information Processing, Biometry, and Epidemiology (IBE)</a>, which is fitting because I am super interested in both Machine Learning (ML) (some people would say AI, but I do not like that term) and Biostatistics...
To be more specific, my research interests are Bayesian Inference, interpretable ML, meta-analysis & reporting methods, and open science.

Originally, I this website was purely intended to promote my career as a researcher and lecturer, but then I realized that it might be a good idea to write some blog posts instead of constantly bothering my co-workers with my strong opinions about everything from why I do not like the term "AI" to why Frequentists are wrong😄 - you can find my posts under [Updates]({{ site.baseurl }}/bog/index.html).
